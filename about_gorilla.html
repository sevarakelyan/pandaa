                                    There are two species of gorilla, each containing two subspecies. The two species
                                    are eastern and western, and the four sub-species are Cross River and Western
                                    Lowland (are sub-species of the Western species) and Grauer’s and Mountain (are
                                    sub-species of the Eastern species). Western gorillas can be distinguished from
                                    other gorilla subspecies by their brownish-gray hair, auburn-colored crests and
                                    overall smaller size. Eastern gorillas tend to be black in color and larger in size.
                                    In all gorillas, males develop silver coloration along their backs as they mature.
                                    The species is diurnal, which means they are active during the day, and of all the
                                    great apes, gorillas are the most terrestrial. This means that they primarily live
                                    on the ground, although they do occasionally climb trees to feed and nest. They are
                                    also able to stand on two legs for short periods of time. </p>

                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Gorillas are the largest of all primates and reach physical maturity between 12 and
                                    15 years of age. Males can be between 350 and 450 pounds, almost twice as much as
                                    females, weighing in between 150 and 250 pounds. Males stand between 5.5 to 6 feet
                                    tall. Females are a bit smaller, standing between 4’7” to 4’11”. The males’ heads
                                    are large and pointed due to the sagittal crest that forms the back of the top of
                                    the head. This crest serves as the foundation for attachment of a great number of
                                    jaw muscle fibers, which allows for the chewing power needed to process tough
                                    vegetation. </p>
                                <p>
                                    The vision and perception of western lowland gorillas is similar to that of humans.
                                    Gorillas have a prominent brow ridge, small, flat ears, and hear about the same as
                                    humans. The nose is broad, flat and fleshy. The wrinkles on a gorilla’s nose, known
                                    as a noseprint, are like human fingerprints, and every individual’s noseprint is
                                    unique. Researchers use these noseprints as identification markers in their studies,
                                    both in zoological settings and in the wild. </p>
                                <p>Gorillas have 32 teeth, including sharp canines used for defense and breaking through
                                    vegetation. Their molars have complicated patterns of cups and ridges that
                                    facilitate chewing of tough plant fibers.</p>
                                <p>Gorillas’ faces, hands, and feet are bare, but the rest of their bodies are covered
                                    with short, thin hair. Gorilla hands and feet are large, with leathery palms and
                                    soles, and broad, flat nails Their hands are very dexterous and can pick up small,
                                    delicate objects. Like their hands, their feet have opposable thumbs and toes. Like
                                    all apes, gorillas’ arms are longer than their legs—a feature that allows them to
                                    walk on all fours. They are called “knuckle-walkers,” meaning that they walk on the
                                    knuckles of their forelimbs and the soles of their hind limbs. This form of
                                    locomotion develops calluses on the knuckles, preserving the sensitivity of the
                                    fingertips necessary for <span class="sec_span">manipulating</span> smaller objects.

                                    other animals unless provoked. However, if they are provoked, they can be dangerous.
                                    They can demonstrate aggression by charging towards perceived intruders. Typically,
                                    they will not actually hit the intruder, but rush past, turn and then charge again.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Infants have three distinct vocalizations; these are similar to the cries of a human
                                    baby. They will typically cry when hurt or frightened, resulting in an immediate
                                    response from the mother. </p>
                                <p>Dominant males also have a distinctive smell that they use to communicate with other
                                    troops and to maintain contact with their own troop. Perhaps the most recognizable
                                    behavior performed by gorillas is chest-beating. It is primarily done by male
                                    gorillas at the end of a display meant to intimidate intruding males or predators.
                                    The sound can be heard for long distances. Females will chest-beat infrequently;
                                    they will typically beat their hands against the insides of their thighs.
                                    Chest-beating can also indicate playful behavior, however, especially in the young.
                                    Young gorillas play much like humans do, playing tag and doing somersaults.</p>
                                <p>Western lowland gorillas live in family groups known as troops. These troops can
                                    consist of 5 to 30 individuals, although the average size is 11. The group is led by
                                    a dominant silverback male and contains several adult females and their young. The
                                    females will typically bond with the silverback, but not necessarily with each
                                    other. The silverback will remain dominant for as long as he can defeat competing
                                    males.</p>
                                <p>There are several younger, blackback males that remain in the group until they are
                                    capable of challenging the silverback. These young males are often driven out of the
                                    troop to live a solitary life or to live in a smaller group with other bachelors
                                    until they establish their own troops. If a dominant silverback is displaced, the
                                    new dominant male will typically kill the infants in the troop, sending the females
                                    prematurely into reproductive cycling. This increases the male’s chances of siring
                                    offspring, as his time as the dominant male is uncertain. As such, females consider
                                    a male’s ability to fight paramount to their offspring’s survival.</p>
                                <p>On maturing, females will also leave their natal group to join a lone male or another
                                    small group. This is vital to prevent inbreeding and to protect the gene pool.</p>
                                <p>Nesting typically occurs in the late afternoon, with the gorillas bedding down for
                                    the night at sundown. The females and their offspring will build nests of leaves and
                                    branches, while the dominant silverback will settle at the base of the tree, in
                                    order to protect his family. At Zoo Atlanta, while the gorillas are outside, their
                                    indoor areas are thoroughly cleaned; the walls and floors are scrubbed with <span
                                        class="sec_span">disinfectant.</span> The gorillas are offered hay in their
                                    indoor area at night and nest with this material, replicating natural behavior.</p>
                                <p>In a troop, the single silverback male will mate with the females, siring all the
                                    offspring of the troop. Females generally reach reproductive maturity between 7 and
                                    8 years of age, with males reaching maturity later, around 10 years of age, due to
                                    competition. The potential breeding season is year-round and gestation typically
                                    takes 256 days, or about 8.5 months. Labor can last anywhere from one to 4 hours.
                                    Babies are usually born singly; twins are rare. Newborns weigh between 3 and 5
                                    pounds and are weaned around 2 to 3 years of age, but can be dependent on their
                                    mothers for up to 4 years. The average interval between births for a female gorilla
                                    is four to six years.</p>

                                </h3>
                                <p>Western lowland gorillas prefer the tall, lush tropical forest of west and central
                                    Africa. The herbs, shrubs and vines that make up its diet grow best where the open
                                    canopy allows plenty of light to reach the forest floor. These tropical forests also
                                    contain a much higher diversity of arboreal substrates and foods, in particular
                                    fruit, than mountainous habitats. Western lowland gorillas live primarily on the
                                    ground and build sleeping nests on the ground or in the trees for the night.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="text none">
                                <h3 class="first_span">
                                    Diet :
                                </h3>
                                <p>Western lowland gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on plant parts including
                                    seeds, leaves, stems, shoots, roots and flowers; however, they prefer fruit whenever
                                    it’s in season. Occasionally they will eat insects, such as termites or ants, as a
                                    supplement to their diet when they are readily available. Due to their dietary
                                    preferences, western lowland gorillas spend a lot of their time in and around trees,
                                    especially fruit trees. Even large males can sometimes be found up in the trees, but
                                    they are careful to stay near a main trunk or on larger branches that are able to
                                    support their weight. Younger, lighter gorillas may climb higher in trees, even
                                    swinging freely from branch to branch. Gorillas never completely strip vegetation
                                    from a single area; rather, the rapid regrowth of the vegetation they consume allows
                                    them to stay within a reasonable confined home range for extended periods of time.

                                <p>Here at Zoo, we provide a medley of fruits and vegetables to our western lowland
                                    gorillas. These include apples, oranges, bananas, raisins, sweet potatoes, cabbage,
                                    collards, and primate chow. In the morning, vegetables and fruit are chopped up and
                                    scattered around the habitat. From there, the gorillas come outside and forage for
                                    their food as they would in the wild. Browse foods including bamboo, banana leaves,
                                    mulberry, elm and willow are also scattered in their habitat.</p>
