                                    Giant pandas are very unusual animals that eat almost exclusively bamboo, which is
                                    very low in nutrients. Because of this, they have many unique adaptations for their
                                    low-energy lifestyle. Giant pandas are solitary, with males and females coming
                                    together only briefly to mate. Habitat loss is the primary threat to this species.
                                    Its popularity around the world has helped the giant panda become the focus of
                                    successful conservation programs.

                                <p>
                                    The low nutrient value of bamboo figures prominently in the biology of the giant
                                    panda. They have extremely powerful jaws and associated muscles to crunch through
                                    the woody stems of bamboo. Each hand bears a <span class="sec_span">specialized
                                        metacarpal bone</span> in the
                                    wrist that functions as a thumb would in humans, to allow them to grasp the circular
                                    bamboo stalks. While other herbivorous animals, such as antelope, zebras, or
                                    rabbits, have very long digestive tracts, the giant panda retains an essentially
                                    bear-like digestive tract. Thus, the digestive efficiency of the bamboo they consume
                                    is quite low. Examination of the feces demonstrates that their food has been only
                                    partially digested. The low nutrient value of their food and their low digestive
                                    efficiency results in an animal that is constrained to a low-metabolism. This
                                    lifestyle explains why giant pandas sleep so often and why they eat such <span
                                        class="sec_span">enormous</span>
                                    amounts of bamboo.

                                    Individuals do not travel long distances, and males will establish territories that
                                    are not particularly large compared with other species in the Order Carnivora. Adult
                                    females average about 230 pounds in weight, with males sometimes reaching 350
                                    pounds. Their hair is very dense, conserving their body heat in their cold habitats.
                                    Their iconic coloration remains a mystery to scientists but may aid with camouflage.

                                    Females are fertile for only a very short period of time and exhibit delayed
                                    implantation. Although twins are not unusual, a mother will typically only rear one
                                    cub. Adults are solitary, with mating pairings being quite brief. The tiny cubs are
                                    altricial, or not born in an advanced state of development, and are completely
                                    helpless, blind and deaf, and without the fur <span

                                    temperatures. As a result, maternal care is extensive. Cubs do not begin eating

                                    a time, but that both receive adequate care.
